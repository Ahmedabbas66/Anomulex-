# ðŸ“‘ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)  
**Project:** Anomulex â€“ AI-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)  
**Version:** v0.1.0-alpha  
**Date:** 2025-09-30  

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this SRS is to define the functional and non-functional requirements of **Anomulex**, an AI-powered Intrusion Detection System.  
The document ensures clarity between stakeholders (researchers, SOC teams, and developers) and provides a baseline for development and validation.  

### 1.2 Scope
- Detect **intrusions and anomalies** in network traffic.  
- Support flow-based monitoring using **NetFlow, IPFIX, CICFlowMeter**.  
- Apply **Machine Learning** to classify traffic into *benign* and *attack categories*.  
- Provide **alerts, dashboards, and reports** for analysts.  
- Operate in both **offline (batch)** and **online (real-time)** modes.  

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations
- **IDS** â€“ Intrusion Detection System  
- **SOC** â€“ Security Operations Center  
- **ML** â€“ Machine Learning  
- **DoS/DDoS** â€“ Denial of Service / Distributed Denial of Service  
- **RBAC** â€“ Role-Based Access Control

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
Anomulex integrates into a network monitoring ecosystem.  
It collects metadata flows, extracts features, applies ML models, and generates alerts.  

[Traffic Source] â†’ [Flow Collector] â†’ [Feature Extractor] â†’ [ML Engine] â†’ [Alerts/Dashboard]

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Collect bidirectional flow records.  
- Extract features (packet size, duration, inter-arrival time, etc.).  
- Train ML models using labeled datasets.  
- Perform inference in real-time.  
- Generate alerts & send them to dashboards.  

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **SOC Analysts** â€“ Monitor dashboards, investigate alerts.  
- **Researchers** â€“ Test models, tune features.  
- **System Administrators** â€“ Manage deployment, scaling, security.  

### 2.4 Constraints
- Must run on **Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+)** or Docker.  
- Requires high throughput support (â‰¥ 10K flows/sec).  
- Metadata only (no payload inspection).  

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Traffic exported via NetFlow/IPFIX is accurate.  
- Training datasets are representative of real-world attacks.  
- Relies on Kafka/Elasticsearch for online mode.
